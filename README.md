# goman - the missing man page for Go binaries

Almost all Go binaries come with no man page, even when properly installed through means like Homebrew.

`goman` substitutes the missing man page by the README file from the Go binary's sources.

## Usage

    goman <go binary file>

## Installation 

    go get -u github.com/christophberger/goman

## License

See `LICENSE*.txt`.
